Sitting has impact on our health
================================

	„Sitting is the new smoking."

– Nilofer Merchant in `Harvard Business Review <https://hbr.org/2013/01/sitting-is-the-smoking-of-our-generation/>`_.

	„In the United States an estimated 149 million days of work per year are lost because of low back pain“

– `WHO <http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/BP6_24LBP.pdf>`_.

	“Poor posture happens easily if one is intensely concentrating on the work at hand. It is very difficult to consciously maintain proper posture.”

– `University of Illinois <http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/posture_study_habits/posture_study_habits.htm>`_.

	“On average, people spend almost half the day (10 hours) sitting and less than 2 hours being active.”

– `British Chiropractic Association <http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/sitting-comfortably-your-back-isnt-267-news.aspx>`_.

1. Set up your working environment
----------------------------------
- Prefer ergonomic chairs.
- Adjust the table and seat height, seat back position and keyboard tilt.
- Make sure the top of the screen is at or slightly below your eye level. If you are using laptop, try stacking on a pile of books to get the height you need and use a remote keyboard and mouse.
- Place your screen at least an arm's length away. 

2. Sit up straight
------------------
- Sit with your bottom against the seat back.
- Sit straight and keep your torso at a 90-105° reclined angle.
- Relax.
- Make sure your elbows and wrists are supported.
- Knees should be slightly lower than your hips.
- Put your feet flat on the floor.
- Set goals and track your progress with **Spine Hero**.

3. Stand up and stretch
-----------------------
Our bodies are built for motion, therefore:

- Take regular breaks – stand up, stretch, change sitting position or simply walk around a little
